# covid19_DA_Queries

This repository is home to several queries which I wrote in SQL over the Google BigQuery Data Warehouse to generate actionable insights on the Global Covid19 Open Dataset. You can use these queries to learn how certain things are done in SQL and refer directly to this Dataset on Google Cloud Platform for your own practice and research purposes.  I might have included screenshots and query results with a LIMIT at certain places to justify a point or highlight some result. 

If you plan on using this dataset, I would recommend using BigQuery to manipulate it as downloading it would be a hectic job due to its huge size of around 12GB. 

I would be adding more and more queries to this repository as I get better questions to ask from this dataset. Until then Ciao!
